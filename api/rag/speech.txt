The world must be made safe for democracy is one of Wilson’s most famous quotes and is often mentioned in discussions of him. With this statement, Wilson was declaring that governments run by just one person (an autocracy), such as Germany’s during World War I, threatened democracy worldwide and must be stopped. Wilson’s speech and America’s entry into World War I is often remembered as a turning point in world history.

In modern times, public and historical opinion of Woodrow Wilson has severely worsened due to his white supremacist beliefs. His statement is still quoted, however, especially in discussions about the United States’ military actions.
